# Highscore web application (inspired by highscore.money)
## What's it about?
It's simple, the more you pay - the higher your ad will be in the table.
## How's it built?
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Jade
- Sass
- Stripe

#### Made in 3 days without any experience in back-end
#### Not launched because I can't register stripe from Belarus
#### It's inexpedient to configurate the server & have this running on it.

### I've launched it on c9.io

# Thanks for visiting! :)
